# Hello / Bonjour / Hallo / 大家好！ 👋

## 🌱 I’m currently learning about ...

📔 **Custom theme creation in WordPress**:

- ⛰️ Using the [bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock) version of WordPress, which uses Composer to install the WordPress core and WordPress plugins.
- 🖼️ The plugin **[Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com)** means the front-end content can be modified from the WordPress back-end. The field group names are referenced in the templates, meaning the content gets updated automatically. No more going through the web developer just to update your website's content.
- 📰 ACF pairs nicely with the **[Custom Post Types UI](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/)** plugin, which allows for custom post types to be declared without writing code.
- 📐 The plugin / theme combo **[Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber)** allows for WordPress templates to be written in the **[Twig templating engine](https://twig.symfony.com/)** **P.S.** No more cluttering templates with PHP! 🤢

🤔 The **JavaScript certificate** from [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org)

🤩 **The Creative React and Redux** course with [developedbyed](https://developedbyed.com/)
