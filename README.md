# Hello / Bonjour / Hallo / 大家好！ 👋

Here are some of the things I am working on.

## JavaScript

**🗿 [JavaScript Capstone Project](https://github.com/hdevilbiss/js-capstone)**: 5 algorithms, tested with Mocha, rendered with React, styled with Sass, and deployed with Google Firebase and GitHub Actions.

**💻 [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting & Functional Programming](https://github.com/hdevilbiss/freeCodeCampJS)**: A messy collection of Markdown and JavaScript files, with a couple Mocha unit tests.

*As part of the JavaScript certificate from [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org)*

## React

**🎵 [HotLink Beats](https://github.com/hdevilbiss/react-music-player)**: A stylish music player which "hotlinks" audio and cover art from ChillHop.com.

**🕯️ [ACME Mobile Meditation Co](https://github.com/hdevilbiss/react-portfolio-website)**: A 3-page portfolio website for a fictional business which provides mobile wellness services.

*Inspired by The Creative React and Redux course with [developedbyed](https://developedbyed.com/).*

## WordPress

Here are some neat tools for creating custom WordPress themes and plugins.

- ⛰️ The **[bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock)** WordPress boilerplate uses Composer to install the WordPress core and WordPress plugins, to name only a couple of its benefits.
- 🖼️ **[Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com)** is an awesome plugin, unlocking lots of creative potential in WordPress, especially useful for [website options](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/options-page/), custom page content, and custom post types.
- 📐 **[Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber)** enables the **[Twig templating engine](https://twig.symfony.com/)** in WordPress.
  - **P.S.** No more cluttering templates with mixed HTML and PHP! 🤢
- **[Extended Custom Post Types](https://github.com/johnbillion/extended-cpts)** by johnbillion is a developer library which I use to declare custom post types in functionality plugins.
